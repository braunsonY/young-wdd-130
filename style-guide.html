            <h2>Fonts</h2>
            <p>
                I have chosen to use the following fonts for my site:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Nato Sans
                </li>
                <li>
                    Noto Serif
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
            <p>
                Movie theaters have been a staple in communities for years. A few movie theater chains have populated the market but they are all virtually identical. That’s why its time for the movie theater industry to evolve with CinemaCity
                Now what makes CinemaCity different than other movie theaters? Most movie theaters get revenue from showcasing new movies and while CinemaCity will do this too, We plan on diversifying how we earn money at CinemaCity, mainly by making it easy and common to rent out a movie theater for a private show. Imagine this, you are a fan of movie theaters and love to go there to watch the newest movie. The only problem is that new movies only come out every once in a while, so you don’t feel like going to the theaters unless there’s a new movie playing. What if you could go to the movies more often to rewatch your favorite movie, or to watch the latest episode of your favorite tv show. CinemaCity can even be used to get a group of friends together to watch any sport or event that you want.
                This way we can bring in casual customers who come to watch a new movie but we can increase how much money we get from more committed customers.
                CinemaCity is the future of movie theaters.

            <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of the CinemaCity website is to increase revenue. By increasing our online presence, we will be able to reach more customers and consumers and persuade them to pick our movie theater.  Ticket sales will increase due to this website
                Another purpose of the CinemaCity website is to share information with our customers. If our website has details about our services and deals that we offer consumers will have more information about why CinemaCity is the right choice for their movie theater needs; movie ticket and concessions prices will increase as more people visit our website and learn about our company.

            <h2>Audience Statement</h2>
            <p>
                We will have multiple target audience is middle class families. People who work decent jobs and decent hours but need a break and an excuse to get out of the house that will also keep the kids entertained. We will also target teenagers who need an activity to do with their friends. They can come to the movies on weekends when they want to relax. Ultimately these groups are missing one thing; excitement in their lives! Sure, people can watch whatever they want on their phones or TVs but going to the movie theaters is an experience and has a memory attached to the movie they watch. 
            </p>

            <h2>Misson Statement</h2>
            <p>
                The mission of CinemaCity is to provide a location for the community to be entertained. To escape to far off places and learn about great stories with their friends and family all from the comfort of their own community. One of CinemaCity’s top priorities is to provide a safe and comfortable location for people to take a break from the demands of life. 
                CinemaCity wants to be a place connected to cherish memories people create.  Memories of Friday nights spent with friends all while watching their favorite movie or an afternoon spent with family.
